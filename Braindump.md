#Braindump

**The braindump is a repository for the fleeting thoughts that further the project at hand but are better picked up at a later stage.**

At the beginning of a new project, when you find yourself in doubt, think: is this best solved by asking for help from someone? You write that this is not critical, you're working on it yourself, but please inform me of your insight.

Dataset_after_KNN is with the original EDL, HDL etc. outcomes

Metadata of individual Quarto documents override global project metadata!

When using the "include" functionality, a single change in the document will cause the document to rerender the "included" Quarto documents as well. Thus, use the "include"-functionality for doing it

After rendering a project with freeze once, you will

In Quarto code block execution options, use "warning: false" and "error: false" to exclude annoying errors, for example I was able to exclude "Loaded Tensorflow Version blaa.blaa"

You will need r-markdown, installed through R itself, in an environment if you want to render a Quarto document.

It does not matter whether you save a conda environment as a .yml, .yaml or .txt; it will be exactly the same

The ideal is that writing code would be as fluent as using a point and click user interface for your statistics and machine learning. For example, think of a function as a a single button in a user interface, although you have the ability to modify the button's behavior when working in code. But still, it is a single button, which is a good perspective for not getting bogged down in the nitty gritty of coding.

To install a python package locally, navigate to the folder and do pip install -e

You could write your result file names as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 etc., depending on the version of a?

Focus more on defining/formulating the problem that you will be solving, so each problem becomes more like a Rosalind-style problem.

wb opens a file in Python in binary format for writing

Ctrl-K *direction arrow* opens a pane in the wanted direction!
Ctrl-W closes panes. This is good to use, since I might have been opening several panes on top of each other, which probably slows down Atom!

What to use for data storage? SQL?

R documentation is easier to read; it is good introduction to reading documentation
