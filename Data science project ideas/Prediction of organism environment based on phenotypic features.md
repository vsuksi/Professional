The beak

Multiclass classification problem.

In this supervised multiclass classification problem, the environments of organisms constitute classes. Measurable phenotypic features (metabolites, expression patterns, morphological features) could thus be correlated with environments. Features which are deemed important for the prediction of environment could thus be thought of as environmental adaptations.

The basic idea could be generalized to

Why is it cool to know what is an environmental adaptation? This information could be used for tracking the such features in a population as a measure of
